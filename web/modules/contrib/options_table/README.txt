INTRODUCTION
------------

The Options Table module provides a Draggable Table widget as an alternative to
the core "Check boxes / radio buttons" widget provided by the Options module.

The Check boxes / radio buttons widget does not allow you to adjust the weight
of the selected options, and the extra feature is provided by this module.

Site administrators can now sort the selected options to be stored in a selected
order.

This module gives support for the core List fields and Entity Reference.
