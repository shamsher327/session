# Changelog

- Implement the Google markup language for products

## Steps:
 The configuration and required modules are added automatically when module is installed. If the configuration is not
 added automatically, you can add it manually following the steps inside validation.

##Validation

  - Check enabled modules:
     - Schema.org Metatag
     - Schema.org Product

  - Check config:
     - Go to admin/config/search/metatag/settings
       - Drop down "Content: Product"
         - Checked Schema.org: Product
     - Go to admin/config/search/metatag
       - Scroll to "CONTENT:PRODUCT"
       - Press "Edit" and check if the configuration is like this:
         - @type: Product
         - name: [node:title]
         - description: [node:field_dsu_product_desc]

         *** image ***
         - @type: ImageObject
         - url: [node:field_dsu_image:entity:url]

  - Open product and press Ctrl+u or right click and select "View Source."
  - Check if <script type="application/ld+json"> exists

## Troubleshooting

- To adjust meta tags for a specific entity, the Metatag field must be added first. Follow these steps:
   1 Go to the "Manage fields" of the bundle where the Metatag field is to appear.
   2 Select "Meta tags" from the "Add a new field" selector.
   3 Fill in a label for the field, e.g. "Meta tags", and set an appropriate machine name, e.g. "meta_tags".
   4 Click the "Save and continue" button.
   5 If the site supports multiple languages, and translations have been enabled for this entity, select
     "Users may translate this field" to use Drupal's translation system.
